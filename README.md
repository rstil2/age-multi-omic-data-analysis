# Age Prediction Using Multi-Omic Data

This project showcases advanced bioinformatics and data science skills through the analysis of gene expression data. It highlights key techniques, including data cleaning, correlation analysis, dimensionality reduction, and predictive modeling to analyze gene expression levels and predict individual age based on multi-omic data.

## Overview
- **Data Cleaning**: Processed and prepped data by handling missing values and standardizing gene expression datasets.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Generated a correlation matrix to visualize relationships between genes and identify significant patterns.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving variance.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed machine learning models to predict individual age based on gene expression profiles.

## Project Files
